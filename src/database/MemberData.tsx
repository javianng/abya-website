The 2022 ABYA business trip to Jakarta further enriched my experience. Immersing myself in the heart of Southeast Asia's business landscape provided invaluable insights into negotiation and communication strategies. This trip underscored the importance of fostering intercultural understanding for successful business interactions. Currently, I have the honour of serving on the ABYA management committee, organising events like pitching competitions and webinars. Working alongside this dedicated team has been instrumental in honing my leadership and communication skills to cultivate a thriving environment for all ABYA members. ABYA is more than just a programme; it's a vibrant community, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to its ongoing success.",
