        Over 60 years ago, the average lifespan of an S&amp;P listed company was
        61 years, while this average falls below 18 years today.
        McKinsey&rsquo;s findings confirm what most of us already know &ndash;
        that it has never been easy for businesses to survive in the long run,
        and this endeavour will only get more difficult in this age of
        disruption.

        Yet, founded in 1919, the Sintesa Group is one of those rare companies
        that is more than a century old and still going strong. On the 24
        <sup>th</sup> of April 2021, ABYA was honoured to host, in its first
        Youth Dialogue session, Abyasa Kamdani &ndash; a fourth-generation
        family member from the family that runs the Sintesa Group.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Speaker introduction</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with an
        Economics degree in 2018, Abyasa worked for a renewable energy company
        in the Bay Area before returning to Indonesia and taking on the role of
        a Business Development Manager in the family business.
      </p>
      <p>
        In experiencing first-hand the transformation of the company over the
        years, Abyasa was in a unique position to share his learnings, in
        straddling the line between family and company, and the future of
        Sintesa Group, in relation to youths and Southeast Asia.

        The Sintesa Group&rsquo;s Transformations
      </h2>
      <p>
        As much as Sintesa Group is a renowned investment holding company today,
        it was not always in this line of business. In 1919, Abyasa&rsquo;s
        great-grandfather Oey Kim Tjiang started the company as a humble rubber
        plantation. However, in 1959, trading became the company&rsquo;s core
        business, and the company was transformed yet again in 1999 to become
        what it is today, with its four main business pillars in Property,
        Energy, Consumer Products and Industrial Products. Across the last 100
        years, the Sintesa Group has grown from a monoline business to an
        operating conglomerate to a responsible strategic investor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adaptability is clearly embedded within the company&rsquo;s DNA, and it
        is therefore no surprise that the Sintesa Group has embarked on a
        digital transformation strategy following the COVID-19 pandemic. By
        focusing on Smart Distribution System, Smart Warehouse System,
        E-commerce and Digitalized Supply Chain, the group&rsquo;s subsidiaries
        make a big impact by helping SMEs in Indonesia digitalize.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beyond adapting to the new digital reality brought about by the
        pandemic, the Sintesa Group is also positioning itself for the
        post-COVID economy by making a proactive shift towards sustainability.
        Abyasa shared that the company decided to embark on its next stage of
        evolution in 2020 by incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals
        (SDGs) into their business models. Sintesa Green Energy, Sintesa Health
        and Sintesa Ecotourism are the three projects that the Group has
        committed to as part of its road map towards the SDGs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its hundred-year history, the Sintesa Group has successfully
        undergone multiple reinventions, and the company is clearly not resting
        on its laurels anytime soon. When asked about the secret behind its
        successful transformations, Abyasa shared that a significant part of it
        lies in the mindset of the company&rsquo;s leaders. The company&rsquo;s
        current transformation efforts, for example, can be attributed to
        Abyasa&rsquo;s mother who strongly advocated for business
        transformation, as CEO of the Sintesa Group.

        Family Business: Straddling the Line between Family and Company
      </h2>
      <p>
        Naturally, this leads us to the question: how does it feel like to work
        for one&rsquo;s own grandparents and parents? While most of us may
        imagine that to be a difficult position, Abyasa shared that this became
        an opportunity to spend more time with his grandfather, since starting
        work in the family business. Being involved in the business has helped
        him learn more from his grandfather and deepened his respect and
        appreciation for his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abyasa sees it as both his responsibility and his honour to sustain the
        legacy of the Sintesa Group as a fourth-generation family member. While
        admitting that there is real pressure to “not screw up” a
        hundred-year-old business, he also believes that as a young employee and
        young member of the family, it is his responsibility to look at the
        Sintesa Group with fresh eyes while adopting a business owner&rsquo;s
        mindset by thinking about the business&rsquo; long-term prospects.
        Abyasa shared that going into the family business and helping to expand
        its remit is his way of giving back to the family and contributing to
        the vision shared by his mother and grandfather to build a company which
        creates positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the blurred lines between the personal and the professional
        in a family business also presents challenges that should be carefully
        managed. Abyasa emphasized the importance of building professional
        credibility by adopting the mentality of having a chip on one&rsquo;s
        shoulder and fostering a healthy professional dynamic by creating a
        comfortable environment for colleagues to speak up. It is also important
        to keep familial interests distinct from key business decisions: for
        example, while Abyasa is working on some separate projects that could
        grow to become part of Sintesa Group, he emphasized that the
        Group&rsquo;s decision to invest in his projects must be based on good
        business sense and not just because of familial ties.

        The Future of Sintesa Group: Youths &amp; Southeast Asia
      </h2>
      <p>
        As we move into a post-COVID economy that is increasingly impacted by
        disruption, the session with Abyasa concluded with a discussion about
        how Southeast Asian family businesses such as the Sintesa Group thinks
        about youths and Southeast Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Group&rsquo;s footprint is predominantly in Indonesia, ABYA
        members asked Abyasa how the group intends to compete with the
        up-and-coming tech start-ups to attract young professionals into the
        business. Abyasa shared that the Sintesa Group would first need to
        evaluate what is attractive in start-ups. For instance, if millennials
        are primarily attracted by the work culture in these tech startups, the
        Sintesa Group would need to adjust their own company culture to match
        the aspirations of the talent they are trying to attract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Group adopts a similar attitude of openness and adaptability towards
        the potential of expanding their businesses beyond Indonesia and into
        the rest of Southeast Asia. Abyasa highlighted Entrepreneurship as one
        of the company&rsquo;s core values, and the Group thus adopts an open,
        entrepreneurial mindset when evaluating the opportunities in Southeast
        Asia. While the Group&rsquo;s focus is still on Indonesia, they have
        always been comfortable doing businesses with companies outside the
        country and continues to keep an active look out for integration and
        collaboration opportunities in the rest of the region.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        When compared to prominent public companies or fast-growing tech
        start-ups, family businesses may not capture as much popular attention,
        but their legacy of excellence and continued adaptability of companies
        ensure that they continue to be a force to reckon with in Southeast
        Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this session with Abyasa, ABYA was privileged to get an
        exclusive perspective of a family business from the inside and better
        understand how current and future leaders of these businesses balance
        their family history with the demands of an ever-changing economy. We
        thank Abyasa and the Sintesa Group for this sharing with ABYA and wish
        them all the best in their business endeavours as the region continues
        to benefit from the good work and the ambitions of next generation
        family business leaders like Abyasa.
