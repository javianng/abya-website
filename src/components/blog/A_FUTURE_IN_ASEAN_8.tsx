        Together with The Young SEAkers (TYS), ASEAN Business Youth Association
        (ABYA) organised a webinar on China-ASEAN supply chains on 20 February
        2021 as part of ABYA&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Future in ASEAN&rsquo; monthly
        dialogue. They had the honour of inviting Dr Sanjana Goswami, Assistant
        Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public policy, National
        University of Singapore, to moderate the session alongside 2 esteemed
        panellists: Mr Low Yew Seng, the Director of Shanghai Apolo Medical
        Technology Co Ltd and Former Vice President of ST Engineering, as well
        as Mr Jeffrey Tan, Head of Group Corporate Development &amp; Group
        Technology at YCH Group.

        The recent implementation of RCEP marks a milestone in fostering closer
        business and economic ties between China and ASEAN, two of the most
        promising Asia Pacific economies. Integrated global value chains (GVCs)
        fostered by closer regional partnership have brought about abundant
        opportunities for companies and talents alike. Thriving businesses and
        increased employment opportunities have also resulted from the
        increasing connectivity and collaboration between the two economic
        powerhouses, both of which account for 30% of the world's population and
        GDP. In the webinar, the panellists shared the major trends and
        opportunities in ASEAN-China business dynamics, challenges faced in this
        new era of supply chain management, and how youths can better equip
        themselves with the necessary skills and experiences.

        Challenges in Global Value Chains and Processes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Starting from a macro perspective of GVCs and processes, the panellists
        shared their personal experiences in the industry. Jeffrey shared his
        experiences before the pandemic, noting that goods and trade are moving
        in a disputative manner. The complexity and different cargo needs result
        in challenges faced in identifying the authenticity of cargo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding to this complexity is the fact that China has its own regulations
        and preferred list of imported goods. Yew Seng addressed the importance
        of knowing the 3C &ndash; China Compulsory Certificate (CCC) and
        preferred list to prevent any potential supply chain and tax issues in
        China. The CCC mark is required for both Chinese-Manufacturers and
        Foreign-imported products to enter into China market. Without the CCC
        mark, China would reject or quarantine the product, delay the products,
        and even claim a warranty on them. Every two years, the Chinese customs
        has its own preferred imported, non-preferred imported and restricted
        products. The list changes regularly, and it is essential to check the
        products according to the updated lists to ensure that it is safe to
        import goods into China.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, a dual court system is utilised in China, with arbitration
        and execution as the two different courts. The arbitration court nearest
        to the supplier's business generally rules on awards meted out in
        arbitration. Yew Seng acknowledged the difficulties faced in the dual
        court system and for the Chinese to travel out of their country due to
        restrictions imposed currently. Yew Seng then advised the participants
        to have contracts signed in Shanghai or Beijing for minor business deals
        due to the shorter duration for arbitration awards to be transferred to
        execution courts if contracts are signed at these locations. Having
        arbitration held in Shanghai or the Beijing International Arbitration
        Centre also enables companies to leverage the legal representative
        blacklisting system more easily and increase company protections.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Supply Chain Disruptions due to COVID-19</h2>
      <p>
        The pandemic situation limits the operational procedures of many MNCs,
        culminating in the need to operate remotely in China. Setting operating
        standards to mitigate risk and having representatives present in the
        company to manage operational needs is thus essential for many
        companies. When Dr Sanjana asked about the disruptions to the supply
        chain industry, Yew Seng shared his difficulties maintaining connections
        with clients due to communication changes from meeting in-person to
        online meetings. Operational challenges such as the fall in shipment
        levels have also occurred with constraints faced by the Chinese customs
        on handling goods being exported out of China. This reflects how the
        pandemic has caused many disruptions in the supply chain industry,
        although the situation has improved for the fourth quarter of 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeffrey shared how Singapore has an advantage in trade negotiations and
        the largest number of free trade agreements (FTA) with different
        countries. This position creates opportunities for companies to leverage
        the FTAs to assist in reducing taxation and tariff burdens in ASEAN and
        China.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a practitioner in the logistics industry, Jeffrey highlighted the
        impacts of the pandemic on the sector. The first blow to the industry in
        Singapore was when Malaysia imposed the Movement Control Order
        restricting trucks from Malaysia entering Singapore. After various
        negotiations, the only essential cargo was allowed into Singapore
        despite the FTA between Singapore and Malaysia. COVID-19 thus reinforces
        the importance of close relations between countries amidst disruptions
        such as natural disasters and other crises. Resilience in the supply
        chain is equally crucial during a global crisis in allowing for
        essential goods to move between the regions. The pandemic has
        demonstrated to youths and future leaders the industries are capable of
        surviving such a crisis and the significance of diversification in the
        supply chain industry.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        Growing Opportunities in the ASEAN region
      </h2>
      <p>
        With the ongoing US-China trade war, Multinational Corporations(MNCs)
        can shift their operations to the ASEAN region. Dr Sanjana asked the
        panellists for their perspectives on how ASEAN countries can benefit
        from the trade war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The US-China trade war has affected GVCs, leading to many MNCs&rsquo;
        decisions to focus on diversification by shifting part of their
        factories and production plants to the ASEAN region. Those MNCs which
        are not operating in the ASEAN region faced specific challenges, but
        these were resolved with companies like YCH which can use their
        extensive network in the ASEAN region to serve MNCs' needs in moving
        their factories out of China. Jeffrey shared his personal experiences on
        how his MNC clients are shifting their production and manufacturing
        operations to other ASEAN countries. Currently, the labour skillsets in
        these ASEAN countries are geared towards simple, less complex
        manufacturing processes. The region's expanding opportunities reflect
        how ASEAN countries need to maintain their political stability and
        improve their infrastructure and labour workforce to manage supply chain
        complexities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeffrey further illuminated how opportunities are rising in the ASEAN
        region, in countries such as Vietnam, which is located next to China and
        has benefited from the relocation of manufacturing activities from
        China. Vietnam is also the ASEAN country with the highest growth
        potential with large cross border trade flows from China. As such, goods
        from the Western and Eastern parts of China often travel from Yunnan or
        Guangxi through Vietnam before arriving in countries such as Malaysia,
        Thailand, and Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the challenges faced in the pandemic situation, a country like
        China has shown its ability to recover swiftly. Yew Seng explained how
        China can maintain positive growth, especially in the construction
        industry, while Jeffrey analysed the entrepreneurial mindset of the
        Chinese and their ability to deal with the pandemic situation swiftly.
        China has also come up with a dual-circulation strategy by relying on
        internal consumption based on its belief that GDP can be boosted more
        sustainably by relying on the Chinese population.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        Ability to learn from challenges in ASEAN and China
      </h2>
      <p>
        On a final note, Dr Sanjana asked the panellists about their opinions on
        future trends and what youths should learn to succeed in the changing
        environment.Yew Seng shared about the new manufacturing concept of
        additive manufacturing and the emerging trend of 3D machines in China,
        which reduces lapses in the supply chain. He also added that the
        product's origin requirements will also affect companies' decisions in
        buying raw materials. This has resulted in Chinese Small and Medium
        Enterprises (SMEs) switching to have their product raw materials
        originating from ASEAN countries, as many ASEAN countries have
        protectionist policies that limit foreign companies from investing
        heavily in the region. Chinese companies thus often tailor their supply
        chain flows to meet such country of origin requirements. Due to Chinese
        aversion towards outsourcing practices, it is difficult to convince them
        to subcontract operations out to local companies or to partially invest
        in production plants in the region. ASEAN countries thus need to develop
        more appealing ways by investing more in infrastructure to attract
        amplified support from Chinese companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeffrey revealed that the RCEP benefits people from the ASEAN and China
        region in that the agreement provides more connectivity and movement
        choices for cargo flows. The RCEP reflects how countries are more
        connected in a globalised society, which facilitates free trade and
        unlocks opportunities for people interested in doing business. Youths
        would hence have more options to be involved in regional activities, and
        embark on business opportunities. However, this increasing regional
        connectivity may bring challenges such as an increase in potential
        competition as the playing field has been levelled for youths across
        ASEAN. Therefore, they must innovate and embrace these challenges,
        anticipating and adapting to market trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Jeffrey pointed out the diverse cultures in ASEAN and
        China, which may pose challenges to people interested in navigating the
        regions. He advised youths to be practical and get on the ground to
        grasp unspoken business norms and to learn the importance of being
        flexible by adapting to each country's norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, ABYA would like to thank Dr Sanjana Goswami, Mr Low Yew Seng,
        and Mr Jeffrey Tan for sharing their personal and professional insights
        on the factors that have guided their careers in China and ASEAN, as
        they see a future in ASEAN. With these insights, ABYA will continue to
        establish connections between ASEAN and Singaporean youths, whilst
        helping to cultivate ASEAN-savvy youths with the necessary skills and
        information needed to succeed in a rapidly transforming region.
