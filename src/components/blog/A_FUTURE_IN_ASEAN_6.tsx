        . The panel comprised of  Mr Vincent Ha, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Lyte
        Ventures and Chairman &amp; Co-Founder of Gushcloud International; Ms
        Kanpassorn Suriyasangpetch (Eix), CEO &amp; Co-Founder of OOCA; and Mr

        The speakers shared about their own personal journey as an entrepreneur
        and emerging opportunities in the ASEAN region for budding
        entrepreneurs.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">A strong sense of purpose</h2>
      <p>
        During the panellists&rsquo; sharing of their personal journey as an
        entrepreneur, a common and strong sense of purpose lies behind their
        enterprising spirit. From their perspectives, a clear notion of
        &lsquo;why&rsquo; is crucial in sustaining their enterprising passions.

        As a parent, Vincent shared his worries of how the future of work
        affects his own children. He observed an increasing trend of
        freelancing, especially in the social media space. Freelancers face
        greater instability and limited access to traditional financial
        services. For example, to access bank loans, traditional banks often
        require an official payslip. This requirement excludes freelancers since
        they do not receive regular income. Therefore, Vincent worked to
        establish an ecosystem to support the growth of influencers in the
        social media marketing industry and a financial tech solution to make
        financial services more accessible for freelancers.

        Eix is not your typical entrepreneur. She was trained as a dentist and
        was on track to become a surgeon. She had a stable and valuable career
        in Thailand. At the same time, in conservative Thailand, mental health
        services are scarce and seeking help still invites stigma. Hence, when
        she faced challenges of getting help for mental health in Thailand, she
        became determined to come up with a solution to make mental health
        support accessible. She eventually gave up her stable career path to
        focus fully on developing a telehealth service for mental health
        support.

        Finally, Rithy also shared his purpose behind his work. He hopes to
        empower the next generation to solve issues that his generation cannot
        solve, and he believes the future lies in technological solutions. To
        this effect, one of his initiatives is to make technology accessible to
        students enmasse in Cambodia through the distribution of laptops
        equipped with open software necessary to learn different technological
        skills. Illustrating the importance of having a clear purpose, he shared
        how by having a clear vision and idea, he managed to convince a landlord
        to rent a space to him at a cheaper rate and advance a loan at the same
        time.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Trends across ASEAN</h2>
      <p>
        The entrepreneurship class in ASEAN is rising and for these budding
        entrepreneurs, our panellists highlighted three trends to take note of.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, ASEAN is a diverse and complicated region. Each country has its
        own unique culture, history and language. Also, ASEAN&rsquo;s rapid
        development and an emerging economy is attracting interest from
        businesses. However, ASEAN&rsquo;s diversity poses significant
        challenges for foreign businesses as they enter the ASEAN market. Local
        Southeast Asian entrepreneurs tend to have an advantage over foreign
        competitors — in navigating the complexities of Southeast Asia due to
        their familiarity within the region. Furthermore, ASEAN provides local
        entrepreneurs with a unique opportunity to plug the gap between the East
        and West.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, Singapore and the rest of ASEAN have a symbiotic relationship in
        terms of entrepreneurship. It may be hard for entrepreneurs to seek
        capital in ASEAN countries apart from Singapore. Eix shared her
        difficulties looking for investors with proper venture capital
        experience in Thailand. On the other hand, focusing on the Singapore
        market alone may pose a limitation for local entrepreneurs. Vincent had
        also described a challenge for local entrepreneurs, in being able to
        find the right market outside of Singapore for their business. Hence, he
        encourages potential entrepreneurs to explore other ASEAN countries.
        This symbiotic relationship is strengthened by increasing webs of
        networks and connections across ASEAN, supported by trade
        infrastructures. For example, cross national financing is easier than
        ever, and many start-ups in the region can seek funding in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, despite the diversity of ASEAN, many ASEAN countries share
        common developmental problems. Hence, it is easy for entrepreneurs to
        export their solutions to other ASEAN nations. Rithy suggests that
        aspiring entrepreneurs should first focus on developing a strong
        solution in one market, seeing through its execution, and establishing a
        strong presence. Thereafter, with the help of the strong network of
        entrepreneurs in ASEAN, the solution can be swiftly replicated across
        other countries in ASEAN.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the speakers shared the purpose behind their drive and passions
        and broad trends in entrepreneurship across ASEAN. With the booming
        industries of emerging technology and digital access, the ASEAN region
        is a growing market with invaluable learning opportunities to the young
        population.
