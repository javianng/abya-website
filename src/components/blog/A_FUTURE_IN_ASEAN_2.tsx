        Together with Singapore Chamber of Commerce Indonesia (SingCham), ASEAN
        Business Youth Association (ABYA) was honoured to host a stellar line-up
        of four panel speakers, namely Khairul Anwar, Regional Group Director
        (Indonesia) of Enterprise Singapore, Lim Kexin, Tax Director of PwC
        Singapore, Joel Shen, Venture Principal and Partner of DWF and Pang Xue
        Kai, CEO of Tokocrypto. The moderator of this session, ABYA&rsquo;s
        second A Future in ASEAN webinar, was Malminderjit Singh, editor at
        Channel NewsAsia.

      <p>
        With the on-going COVID-19 global pandemic, the webinar took place via
        Zoom and ABYA was glad to host over 150 eager participants on the
        evening of 6th June 2020. ABYA would like to thank its supporting
        organisation, Singapore Global Network, for providing ABYA with the
        necessary digital tools.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Market Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        Starting from a macro perspective of Indonesia, the panel speakers
        shared personal realisations towards the emerging market. Khairul shared
        his understanding of Indonesia&rsquo;s market situation, making it
        apparent that Indonesia was managing its economy adeptly prior to
        COVID-19 but it remains too early to ascertain the long-term impact of
        the pandemic on its growth trajectory. The young and growing population
        is fueling rising consumption across sectors, and Khairul encouraged
        Singaporeans to go beyond the resources sector to plug into emerging
        business opportunities in logistics, e-commerce, Fintech and other tech
        startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) lawyer, Joel shared that it does
        not seem that interest has waned across Indonesia. He commended the
        population&rsquo;s strong interest displayed towards the various
        industries, especially the technology sector — Financial Technology
        (Fintech), Advertising Technology (Adtech), Health Technology
        (Healthtech) and e-payment initiatives. Joel remains positive about
        Indonesia&rsquo;s technology industry because this emerging trend may
        likely be able to fill in the gaps of traditional businesses. Xue Kai
        added that there are great opportunities in industries such as
        healthcare, gaming, infrastructure and transport.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Perspectives in Finding New Opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        Indonesia&rsquo;s &lsquo;Unity in Diversity&rsquo; national motto
        reminds us that the country can be viewed in multiple layers, to which
        Kexin added that we may also find &lsquo;simplicity in
        complexity&rsquo;. A culturally vibrant culture such as
        Indonesia&rsquo;s ought to be seen for its opportunities, amidst the
        apparent difficulty which organisations may face prior to investing time
        and effort to learn about the economy and way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Indonesia is set on the right trajectory, Khairul mentioned that
        there are still ongoing business inefficiencies that provide an
        opportunity to identify pain points and propose solutions. One such
        opportunity is in infrastructure and transportation of goods, given the
        fragmentation of many cities that exist within a single country.
        Startups are also poised to bloom in such an environment with tremendous
        opportunity — to which Xue Kai fondly recalled to be the reason, in why
        he had made the choice to start-up in Indonesia. He has continued to
        reside in Indonesia since late 2017, having founded Tokocrypto, the
        first cryptocurrency exchange platform to be approved by the Indonesian
        Commodities and Derivatives Supervisory Board.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Dynamic Interplay of Businesses</h2>
      <p>
        Unique to Indonesia&rsquo;s market is the existence of many large family
        businesses, alongside the many micro-businesses. It was expressed that
        the two types of businesses value-add to business environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interaction between these two types of businesses was described by
        Kexin to be similar to Yin and Yang, a multi dimensional evolution of
        the Indonesia environment can be seen as complementary and evolving.
        Whilst operating at an "intersection that could benefit both in their
        businesses”, these two players need not be seen as two ends of the
        business spectrum. Instead, there are joint opportunities for investment
        and integration, rather than being mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joel believes that we are now living in a world where technology is
        greatly valued by people, thus enabling more tech-enabled businesses in
        e-commerce, travel agencies, and payment initiatives where large banks
        partner with prominent payment companies.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Business Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Familiar to many is Indonesia&rsquo;s road scene, which may often leave
        the outsider in awe with how drivers are able to maneuver their way
        through the seemingly nonlinear system of traffic. This was used as an
        analogy, by Kexin, to describe how there are not always lines that can
        be seen, yet implicit behaviours and cultural codes guide the traffic
        and other interactions in Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kexin gave her advice to aspirants looking to venture into Indonesia —
        to accept that the country&rsquo;s situation may not always be as it
        appears to be, at first glance. Instead, one should expect the
        unexpected, whilst appreciating the fundamentals and cultural nuances to
        best steer one&rsquo;s organisation and career in the sometimes fluid
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The differences in the ways of doing business between Singapore and
        Indonesia, was also exemplified by Khairul. It does seem that work
        culture in Singapore places a higher emphasis on task-orientation and
        adherence to Standard-Operating-Procedures (SOPs). On the other hand,
        the work culture in Indonesia requires more time invested in human
        connections to facilitate healthy business relationships. The speakers
        had also shared about their personal realisations, that it is important
        to “know who, to know how” to complete a work task, in Indonesia&rsquo;s
        business setting.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Venturing into Indonesia</h2>
      <p>
        Popular locations to set up in Indonesia include Jakarta, Batam and
        Bali. While these are undoubtedly business hubs, Khairul encourages one
        to also consider the other areas of the archipelago of 17,000 islands.
        There are many areas of opportunities for the Singaporeans&rsquo;
        pursuit of careers elsewhere, such as real estate, financial services,
        e-commerce, manufacturing, farming, hospitality and transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key point of interest from the youth audience was also in identifying
        the ideal age and duration that one should plan for their overseas
        career, in a market such as Indonesia. Xue Kai had thus impressed upon
        the audience that “there is no right time”. The decision to set up a
        business, the execution of it and the connections established are
        dependent on one&rsquo;s maturity, that may not necessarily tie with
        age. It was instead expressed that one should be committed to spending
        at least three years in-market, to get a deep sense of the cultural
        intricacies and business dealings. Joel had also noted that should one
        decide to do so, he or she would need to embrace the unknown with
        open-mindedness and a sense of adventure. This is especially given that
        the work opportunities would not be traditionally familiar with what is
        available in Singapore.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Emerging Trends</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the movement of capital has been
        put on hold. When asked about other emerging trends, Khairul mentioned
        that geographically, Jakarta remains the most cosmopolitan landscape.
        However, he strongly advised aspiring entrepreneurs to adopt “Jakarta
        Plus One” approach, which refers to venturing into Jakarta and one other
        city to expose one&rsquo;s self to opportunities in other emerging
        cities. For example, Surabaya, the second largest city of Indonesia,
        presents opportunities of a slightly different flavour than Jakarta,
        however also introduces different business opportunities. Joel
        elaborated that there are other places showing positive business trends
        as well, such as Bali, Malang and Bandung — especially in the technology
        sector to ensure better quality of life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Seeing a Future in ASEAN</h2>
      <p>
        On a final note, the panel had recalled their experiences and reasons
        which kept them invested in building their careers in Indonesia. It was
        shared by Joel, that the reasons to which expatriates stay or leave may
        be quite apparent, given that the initial impressions of traffic and
        pollution may deter one from further pursuing this opportunity. However,
        other aspirants who choose to look past such immediate circumstances may
        instead appreciate Indonesia for its culturally rich landscape and
        tremendous economic growth opportunity. Emphasising on personal
        development, Khairul also mentioned that gaining experience in this key
        Southeast Asian market at some point in your career would enrich your
        skills portfolio and be a good way of differentiating oneself from other
        professionals in the same trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABYA would like to thank the panel for the personal and professional
        sharing on the factors that have guided their careers in Indonesia, as
        they see a future in ASEAN. With these insights, ABYA will continue to
        establish connections between ASEAN and Singaporean youths, whilst
        constantly seeding information influence to nurture ASEAN-savvy youths.
