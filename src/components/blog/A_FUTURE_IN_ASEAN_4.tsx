        <strong>Youth Political Activism in Thailand</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        To give us a better understanding of the student protests taking place
        in Thailand, Professor Punchada provided us with a context of recent
        Thai politics. She shared that grievances aired during the protests have
        roots in Thailand&rsquo;s 2019 General Election.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2019 Thai General Election was the first election in 5 yearssince
        the military coup in 2014. The 2019 election was also unique in that for
        the first time in about 50 years the military is trying to maintain its
        political power through democratic processes, as evidenced from the
        drafting of a new constitution and the formation of its own political
        party to contest in the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, the military backed party garnered 116 seats in parliament
        while a new rising party with considerable youth support &ndash; Future
        Forward Party, managed to win 81 seats, which was significantly higher
        than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Punchada explained that many youths and students in Thailand
        were disgruntled that the senate was essentially appointed by the
        military, and in turn, the senate naturally voted for Prayut Chan-o-cha
        to be the Prime Minister. Moreover, the Future Forward Party that was
        popular with the youths was dissolved earlier this year and banned from
        politics. This led to a large number of university students organizing
        flash mobs around universities in the country such as Mahidol
        University, Chulalongkorn University and Thammasat University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, Professor Punchada shares that the recent youth political
        activism in Thailand has led to a surge in the number of students
        signing up for her political science class this semester from around 30
        to more than a 100, signifying the growing interest in youths to learn
        more about the politics of their own country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent resurfacing and growth of the student protests is attributed
        to the youth&rsquo;s unhappiness with the government extending a state
        of emergency to continue the fight against Covid-19, as they perceive
        that the government is only doing this to further control and quell the
        student protests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Student protestors now have 3 main demands: the dissolution of
        parliament and the calling of new elections, the amendment of the
        current constitution, and last but not least, an investigation into
        allegations of abductions and killings of Thai dissidents outside the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude, Professor Punchada hopes that the government can set up
        panels to engage the students in discussions, giving them a chance to
        negotiate for peace. She also believes that the government should
        restrain from using force as it would only escalate the situation.

          History of Youth involvement in Indonesia&rsquo;s Political Landscape
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        “It is hard to understate the political power that the term
        &lsquo;pemuda&rsquo; (which means youth in Indonesia) has … it evokes
        this heroic dynamism, vitality, that is in some respects central to the
        creation of the Indonesian nation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Professor Davidson, youth involvement in the politics of
        Indonesia can be traced back to the colonial period and the birth of
        both Indonesian nationalism and the Indonesian nation: many of
        Indonesia&rsquo;s great nationalist leaders were young university
        students in their early to mid-20s.
      </p>
      <p>
        He highlighted that the 1928 Youth Congress was a symbolic moment that
        marked the start of Indonesian politics.as it brought together different
        youth organisations across the archipelago. “It is hard to separate the
        concept of … Indonesian politics from youth politics, they are one and
        the same in some respects.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Following independence, the youth continued to be politically dynamic in
        Indonesia but there were splits in the 1950s and 60s, along the Left
        (who were leaning towards Communism) and a Right more conservative youth
        group called &lsquo;Kammi&rsquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Suharto&rsquo;s New Order, many youths who helped bring him to
        power became disillusioned with the regime and soon fell out of favour
        with the government. After the infamous Malari riots of 1974, all
        politics were unfortunately banned from university campuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three main branches of students appeared: those who became politically
        apathetic, those who continued to channel their political activism by
        forming and joining NGOs outside of their university, and those who
        became more Islamic and conservative, a group that gradually
        spreadthroughout Indonesia&rsquo;s universities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Davidson highlights that students played a large role in
        Suharto&rsquo;s downfall, especially those in Yogyakarta, who were the
        first to take to the streets, leading to a cascade across the nation.
        However, he remarks that today, student activism and youths are in
        discomforting times and seem rudderless compared to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        In examining the role of youths in politics and business in Indonesia
        today, Professor Davidson shares two case studies. To illustrate how
        politically rudderless Indonesian students and youths have become during
        Indonesia&rsquo;s democratic era, he mentions Budiman Sudjatmiko, a
        former student activist who has now joined President Jokowi&rsquo;s
        party as a politician. The second example he brought up is that of
        Nadiem Makarim, founder of Gojek and one of Indonesia&rsquo;s most
        prominent businessmen; Nadiem has now been co-opted by Jokowi&rsquo;s
        government as the country&rsquo;s Minister of Education and Culture and
        the new symbol of youth in Indonesia.

        <strong>
          Impact of Youth Activism on Politics in Malaysia and Singapore
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah shared that there has been a
        rise in youths and younger candidates who are directly involved in
        electoral politics in Singapore and Malaysia. Such examples include the
        high profile opposition candidate Nicole Seah in Singapore, and the
        previous Minister of Youth and Sport Syed Saddiq in Malaysia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Youths are also at the forefront of social discourse in three main
        areas: LGBT issues, climate change and race. While there is greater
        pushback against LGBT issues in a largely conservative Muslim Malaysia,
        the LGBT movement has gained more ground and sympathy in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Walid also mentioned that youths in both countries are more
        concerned and vocal about climate change and environmental conservation.
        This can be attributed to the fact that youths will have to live with
        the tangible effects of environmental neglect for longer than the older
        generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally prominent in youth activism in Malaysia and Singapore is the
        discourse about race. Youths are increasingly aware of possible sources
        of racial inequality and are not afraid to discuss these issues
        publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open discussion over social media is also facilitated and catalyzed by
        "woke" language imported from the West. This was clearly seen recently
        in the surge of youths talking about the Black Lives Matter movement
        after George Floyd's death. Many tried to link it back to the local
        context to show how certain policies and mindsets may lead to racial
        inequality, such as "Chinese Privilege".
      </p>
      <p>
        The push for change in how we approach race has, perhaps, the greatest
        impact on politics in Malaysia and Singapore. After all, political
        structures in both countries are heavily driven by race, and any change
        to public opinion will certainly influence the political sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this conclusion, Professor Walid argued that there will
        be a need to re-negotiate the social contract between races in Malaysia.
        The political status quo is that Malays hold political power, while the
        Chinese dominate the economic sphere. However, the people of today
        cannot be expected to be comfortable with this social contract that was
        formed in 1957.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Singapore, youths have also sent the ruling People's Action Party a
        strong signal that they will not accept "gutter politics" and that the
        way they think about race is vastly different from older generations.
        This signal came in the form of mass support for opposition candidate
        Raeesah Khan during GE2020 after police reports were made against her
        online comments that allegedly accused Singaporean law enforcement
        authorities of racial and religious discriminationRaeesah Khan's team
        went on to win Sengkang GRC, a significant victory for the Opposition
        since GRCs tend to favor the ruling party in elections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrapping up, Professor Walid summarized that youth activism, especially
        in Singapore tend to toe the line when opposing governmental policies.
        However, youth voices are still heard and have a definite impact on
        politics in Malaysia and Singapore going forward.
      </p>

        <strong>State - Business Relationships</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Opening the Q&amp;A segment was the question, "How are politics and
        business intertwined and do we see the recent political developments
        changing that relationship?". In short, business and politics in
        Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are tightly linked.These
        linkages come in the form of patronage, where businesses donate capital
        to the government in exchange for a favorable business environment
        including but not limited to - protected markets, government contracts,
        and projects. Gojek and CP were also raised as examples of huge
        government-backed companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a general consensus across the panel that recent political
        developments will not and have not challenged this relationship, and
        have in fact, strengthened such relationships in Thailand.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>Social Media and Youth Activism in ASEAN</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Attendees also posed questions on whether social media would lead to a
        more common opinion of politics amongst youth in ASEAN and how we as
        youth can interact responsibly on social media so as to avoid getting
        stuck in echo chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a general consensus that social media is potentially more
        divisive and will not, in and of itself, lead to a homogeneity of ideas
        across the ASEAN region. Asst Prof Walid cautioned against thinking that
        social media is the be all and end all, and that there can bea certain
        upper middle class snobbery present in the language used on social media
        in political discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citing the case where blacks in America aren't as enthusiastic about
        Kamala Harris potentially being the first black Vice-President as
        compared to the hype around it on social media, Asst Prof Walid showed
        that social media is certainly not representative of everyone's opinion
        or stance on issues.
      </p>
      <p>
