        ASEAN Business Youth Association (ABYA) held its first event on 21st
        March 2020, rallying a crowd of 52 anticipative youths. Undeterred by
        the recent COVID-19 pandemic, youths were eager to &lsquo;Talk about
        ASEAN&rsquo;, nonetheless erring on the side of caution with social
        distancing practised throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Held at *SCAPE HubQuarters, the event also marked ABYA&rsquo;s official
        launch since its preliminary pitch at the Youth Action Challenge. The
        preliminary pitch took place a month prior, on February 1 2020, during
        which the National Youth council had granted ABYA a seed funding of
        $5000 to start its activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In light of this, ABYA kicked off the event with a snippet of the
        feedback received from its preliminary pitch. ABYA had received public
        commendation by Senior Parliament Secretary, Dr Tan Wu Meng. His speech
        subsequently recorded and published on his{" "}

        .
        <p>
          In Dr Tan&rsquo;s speech, he shares his aspirations for ABYA&rsquo;s
          youths to continue blazing their trail with a “spirit of adventure” to
          bring “young people&rsquo;s ideas, skills and capabilities..going to
          markets outside Singapore, throughout ASEAN, where there is a big
          growth story happening before of our eyes”.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Let&rsquo;s Talk About ASEAN</h2>
      <p>
        Another memorable activity held on this day was ABYA&rsquo;s focus group
        discussion, which sought to create informal spaces for youths to start
        conversations through personal sharing and collaborative discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the audience&rsquo;s surprise, the short 30-minute activity had given
        ample opportunity for many to establish meaningful connections. In
        recounting their own experiences and unpacking critical assumptions, the
        youth&rsquo;s conversations had taken a positive turn towards their
        outlook for the future. Central to these discussions were the
        youth&rsquo;s aspirations and qualms about venturing into ASEAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group discussions had encouraged the youths to recall their past,
        for them to understand how their experiences may have triggered a
        greater interest in ASEAN, whilst shaping their personal development.
      </p>
      <p>
        A recurring theme of &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; was established, in which
        these youths shared that they were humbled by the cultures experienced
        when visiting the ASEAN countries. Several youths had a similar
        realisation — that it is often easy to enter a country with ethnocentric
        views. It was mentioned that such feelings often undermine their ability
        to truly immerse in the culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethnocentrism refers to the evaluation of another&rsquo;s culture, based
        on one&rsquo;s own culture and norms experienced. The result of
        ethnocentrism is that one may start to feel that another&rsquo;s culture
        is unacceptable or even inferior to his or her own. The youths had told
        their stories of working with locals in the ASEAN countries, where they
        had realised the importance of entering a country with a humble
        intention to learn, rather than assume a position of authority, or that
        they understand the country&rsquo;s culture. This would be crucial in
        reducing the likelihood of appropriating one&rsquo;s own culture, whilst
        proposing misaligned solutions — to a country that otherwise seems
        &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; to the unkeen observer.

        Young NTUC: Aligning with Nation Building Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
        ABYA had also invited its mentor and supporting partner, Wendy Tan, to
        stage. She is Head (Covering Director) for the National Trade Union
        Congress&rsquo; youth development wing, Young NTUC. Young NTUC was proud
        to announce that ABYA had recently become officially recognized as one
        of its Affinity Groups. Through Young NTUC&rsquo;s Affinity Groups, both
        ABYA and Young NTUC pledges for mutual support and recognition for its
        partners&rsquo; activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most significantly, Wendy introduced ABYA and Young NTUC to both have
        their visions aligned with Singapore&rsquo;s nation building goals. Such
        visions hinge on the future of SIngapore&rsquo;s workforce, youths, to
        be ready to work with or in the ASEAN countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wendy also shared the national imperative, as announced in the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-need-to-be-more-connected-to-asean-to-remain-competitive-panel">
          Straits Times
        </a>{" "}
        . It quoted director of Economic Development Board, Chng Kai Fong, "We
        need to get to know ASEAN better because that's how we're going to make
        our living, by facilitating connections in ASEAN,".
      </p>
      <p>
        The criticality of ASEAN-readiness was once again highlighted, as Wendy
        touched upon Trade and Industry Minister, Chan Chun Sing&rsquo;s speech
        featured on{" "}
        <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/global-ready-talent-programme-ftas-smes-chan-chun-sing-11308286">
          Channel News Asia
        </a>
        . He had emphasised that over 50 per cent of Singaporean enterprises
        faced difficulties in expanding overseas given the insufficiency of
        right talent for their overseas operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, keen insights from Young NTUC&rsquo;s youth ASEAN-readiness
        survey on close to 1300 youths was shared. The research had uncovered
        that 57% of youths are willing to take an opportunity to be based in
        ASEAN for a period of 2 years, while the age range of 24-35 is most
        receptive to working abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young NTUC&rsquo;s data findings have been one of many ways that Young
        NTUC has shaped the development of ABYA &ndash; the data has enabled
        ABYA&rsquo;s understanding that youths are willing to envision
        themselves experiencing and adjusting to the culture and economy of the
        ASEAN countries. Youths may be even more receptive, given their early
        career and life stage. This could make them less likely to be held back
        by prior commitments which would discourage them from venturing abroad
        for work.

        Guest Sharing: Advocating for Work Abroad
      </h2>
      <p>
        ABYA was pleased to have Smith Leong, a Young NTUC ASEAN Career Mentor,
        to give his advice on working in ASEAN. Seeing through the lens of a
        digital marketer who has lived and worked in Thailand, the audience was
        impressed by Smith&rsquo;s affable and honest sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smith had shared that reaching a native level of proficiency in a
        foreign language is admittedly challenging, however should not deter
        people from working abroad. Instead, he gave the advice that one&rsquo;s
        network and ability to foster new connections would be another essential
        skill, which he was able to hone during his independent travels in
        Thailand.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        Guest Sharing: Envisioning Success in ASEAN
      </h2>
      <p>
        The next speaker was Rusydi Khairul, who heavily invests his time
        mentoring youth-led startups and curating Entrepreneurship Education
        programmes, with Reactor, a company he co-founded. His perspectives have
        also been shaped by his previous engagement as a SPRING Executive
        Development Scholar, while he still consults for small medium
        enterprises (SMEs) in the domain of Business Excellence (BE), across the
        7 categories of Leadership, Customers, Strategy, People, Processes,
        Knowledge and Results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rusydi&rsquo;s insights certainly intrigued the audience, as he
        highlighted the desirable competencies to succeed in ASEAN, alongside
        future opportunities within ASEAN. Firstly, being able to succeed in
        ASEAN would require tacit skills, most notably in the ability to work
        with peers from other ASEAN countries and contextualizing ideas based on
        the cultural nuances. Secondly, ASEAN is rife with opportunity,
        especially in the following areas &ndash; FinTech paired with social
        networks, education through travel, and agriculture using IoT.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Moving Forward</h2>
      <p>
        ABYA&rsquo;s event attendees and speakers had shared their aspirations
        towards a future in ASEAN. This event had certainly left the youths
        hopeful with an opportunity to be seized, enabled through initiatives
        such as this event, that will continue to enable ASEAN-readiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the ABYA team, these takeaways had given it considerable insight
        into the motivations in learning about ASEAN, as well as the gaps
        realized in reaching such aspirations. As the team then reflected on the
        needs of youths, it proceeded with crafting an end-to-end development
        programme, aimed at preparing youths with ASEAN-readiness. Highly
        encouraged by its partner and youth community&rsquo;s support, ABYA will
        continue striving to cultivate greater ASEAN awareness, interest, and
        developmental opportunities for youths to be able to work with or in the
        ASEAN countries.
