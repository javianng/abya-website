        <strong>Malminderjit Singh, </strong>
        Regional Content Lead and Senior Account Director of Hume Brophy, to
        complete the program as a moderator, several takeaways emerged from a
        webinar that merely lasted an hour and a half.

        <b>Pursuit of one&rsquo;s purpose</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first portion of the webinar was led by Atty. Celera takes pride in
        the sustainable operations of Manila Water which has been providing a
        “reliable, safe, inclusive, transparent, and responsive water supply and
        sanitation services through best fit practices.” During the pandemic,
        Manila Water assumed responsibility to provide 24/7 round-the-clock
        water supply to communities. She emphasized the formula to
        sustainability which was balancing between environmental and economic
        impact. She also shared that Manila Water is equipped with digital
        technology and continuously innovates for resilience and
        sustainability.Wafa Taftazani furthered the conversation by introducing
        his innovative business model which he had planned during the pandemic.
        He started by surveying small businesses which 94.7% reported a drop in
        revenue and 72% to be at the brink of bankruptcy. Based on these data,
        he created the Modal Rakyat, which allowed start-up businesses to
        function on indirect investments. Soon enough, Modal Rakyat flourished
        into an accomplished company with a social cause. Despite this,
        Taftazani still continued to create more fintech platforms that cater to
        different entrepreneurs, including one for content creators.

        <b>Lessons from the journey</b>
      </h2>{" "}
      <p>
        The second half of the webinar was spearheaded by Malminderjit Singh. He
        asked the speakers regarding the 3 habits that a “successful” person
        should have. Atty. Celera draws from her own experience. The first habit
        she emphasizes on is her willingness to continuously learn and be open
        to opportunities to study, and to apply the knowledge gained and
        challenge already existing ideas. Second is the mindset to excel and
        never be contented with just doing substantial. Lastly, Atty. Celera
        places importance on good character, having empathy, compassion and
        heart to be of help to others, especially those in need.Taftazani also
        speaks from his experience. He told his story during the first few
        months of the pandemic wherein everything had stopped functioning and
        everyone were forced to isolate. He revealed that it was during that
        time that he personally learned about the benefits of meditation. To
        compliment his meditations, , he would do daily intermittent fasting,
        strictly eating only from 12pm to 6pm. This has surprisingly helped him
        focus in the morning as he does not need to think about breakfast,
        freeing up more time for other tasks.

        The next question thrown by Singh is the key traits that the audience
        should hold to help them achieve their desired careers and to make them
        uniquely stand out. Atty. Celera once again went first and answered the
        importance of having technical skills to actually be good at your job to
        be competent and competitive at the workplace. She went on to describe
        the best traits of a leader which is to be actively involved and to be
        empathetic. However, she also mentioned that leadership skills is not
        always about leading others because sometimes you also need to lead
        ourselves individually. Taftazani acknowledges Atty. Celera&rsquo;s
        answer regarding technical and added to it business and management jobs.
        He also brought out the discussion about remote working being an
        irreversible trend, which is why it is important to know how to lead
        through social media channels.

        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Overall, the webinar ended with a lot of meaningful insights from the
        speakers and from the moderator. After the event, the audience were also
        given the opportunity to ask questions using padlet, wherein the
        speakers were able to answer them one-by-one. Indeed, we are
        transitioning to a modern era with new trends, and new digital platforms
        are perhaps the few better ways to conquer the anxiety of tomorrow. ABYA
        would like to thank everyone who had made this webinar possible as well
        as having the opportunity to be contributory to such a productive event.
