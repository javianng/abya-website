        <strong>Why start/join a tech company?</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Even as they hail from dissimilar industries, whilst having contrasting
        professional backgrounds, it was clear that there are common viewpoints
        between Effendy and Johnny. It was the prospect of opportunity in
        Indonesia, during the time of founding their start-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johnny recounted that the emergence of Indonesia&rsquo;s present
        decacorns and unicorns, coupled with the increasingly tech-savvy younger
        generation, had formed the basic ingredient which catalysed
        digitalization in Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing the rapid rise of such tech companies over the past 5-6 years,
        Johnny realized that this was going to be the next big thing. “If you
        know that this is the change that is going to happen…very fast
        and…choose to not embrace [those] changes, you would be irrelevant.”
        This spurred him on to take the leap of faith and risk to be part of the
        technology industry. Similarly, Effendy too rode on the digital wave
        that was spreading throughout Indonesia, by founding his own company -
        Rentfix to help digitize the property industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effendy had identified several opportunity areas in real-estate in
        Indonesia, having been a seasoned industry veteran for seven years. In
        particular, he took notice of the low digital adoption rate in
        conducting business transactions and strove to make a more positive
        impact by digitizing the real-estate industry in terms of better
        managing the supply and demand of properties so that valuable properties
        are not left unused. Echoing Effendy&rsquo;s own motivations, Johnny
        remarked that “the vision of starting a company…always [starts] from the
        pain points of why people feel miserable in that industry”, which in his
        own automobile industry was to try to make the process of buying and
        selling used cars more transparent.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>Challenges faced in their entrepreneur journey</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Effendy highlighted that one of the challenges, faced when starting
        Rentfix, was in trying to inspire believers in the company&rsquo;s value
        proposition. It was reflected that stakeholders who are more senior in
        the industry may not have witnessed the prevalence and importance of
        digitalization, unlike newer entrants to the market - youths, who would
        be more reactive to this upcoming trend.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Effendy reiterated that such challenges could also create new
        possibilities that could further the digital economy in the real-estate
        industry. Most importantly, he shared that for entrepreneurs who are
        just starting something and have yet to find success, much persistence
        and grit is required to keep one going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johnny views the challenges he faces from two perspectives; one being
        the external and the other being the internal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the external realm, he cites an example such as Indonesia&rsquo;s
        non-uniform infrastructure, which could hinder the prospects of starting
        a nationwide business. The challenge of building trust with consumers
        when doing business, especially online, was noted to be key in sustained
        consumer usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In examining internal influences, he then referred to his own business
        and self, to which he brought up the issue of talent development. He
        highlighted the challenge of hiring for the right skill sets, while many
        of which are often not taught in schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he currently manages his own company, Johnny gave a personal
        reflection that it is most vital for leaders to continuously push
        themselves and channel the belief that their endeavour would be
        successful, whilst adding value to the community. He warned the audience
        on the impact of one's doubts about their own business, which could
        likewise have a contagious effect in dampening the morale of the team.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>Doing business in Indonesia</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        An adventure in itself, working in Indonesia would provide one with
        plenty of opportunity, especially in tackling the ongoing business
        inefficiencies. Barring the transport system and traffic in Jakarta, the
        lifestyle in Jakarta can be said to be on a similar level to that of
        Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        In comparison to Indonesia a decade ago, Indonesia is more urbanized
        than ever, while massive investments are flowing into Indonesia
        aggressively, signifying the growing confidence in Indonesia&rsquo;s
        economy. By venturing into Indonesia as soon as possible, one could
        experience the second decade of the country&rsquo;s digitalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Effendy strongly encourages youths to consider working in
        Indonesia and hopes that they can be the drivers of change for smaller
        companies and sectors that are lagging behind in the digital era.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Technological Breakthroughs</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Drawing examples from the Fintech and e-commerce industry, Johnny
        illustrates how advances in data analytics and machine learning have
        revamped business processes ranging from opening a bank account,
        borrowing money, to making digital payments. Looking at the automobile
        industry which he is currently in, he sees new technologies like
        electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles as the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Underlying the major technological breakthroughs in the various
        industries, are profound developments in Indonesia&rsquo;s social
        demography. Effendy brings to light the fact that despite poor and
        uneven infrastructure across the Indonesian archipelago, the number of
        internet users has doubled to 175 million during the period 2015 to
        2019. Moreover, Indonesia&rsquo;s phone connection and internet user
        growth rate is growing faster than the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The growing population of people with access to the internet indicates a
        strong potential for conducting digital business in Indonesia, and this
        is reflected in how Indonesia has become so attractive to big companies
        hailing from the West and China. Given the vast room for development and
        exponential growth, Effendy is very positive that the way to develop the
        Indonesian economy is through the digital sector.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>How has COVID-19 brought about new changes in Indonesia</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        With the COVID-19 global pandemic, Effendy highlighted several emerging
        trends in Indonesia's digital economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, working towards an inclusive e-commerce industry such as
        providing customized services catered to targeted audiences and
        expanding services to smaller cities and rural areas. There will be a
        growing adoption of digital payment services, notably blockchain-based
        payments in Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the use of virtual services provided in various sectors —
        healthcare, education, entertainment and more. Further, affordable
        touchless technologies to adopt new ways of living in public spaces in
        Indonesia. Even though Effendy shared that Indonesia still has a long
        way to go, its Government is supportive of Industry 4.0 — automation,
        robotic and artificial intelligence — and provides much support for this
        transformation to move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, with the movement of capital from Jakarta to East
        Kalimantan, Indonesia has opened up more spaces for businesses,
        start-ups and innovation to take place in the new capital city. As
        Effendy shared, “It would be like a restart button”, notably in the
        areas of Smart city technologies and e-government services.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>Advice</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        “With the same effort and potential, one serves different scales of
        impact,” says Johnny. Johnny emphasized the importance of maximizing
        one&rsquo;s potential by being lucrative in order to strive in this era.
        Additionally, having a good grasp of business culture in Indonesia is
        equally important as well. Being able to blend into its culture and
        build a strong network within the industry will put one into great
        advantage over others. Furthermore, the ability to gain trust from the
        team is pivotal to one&rsquo;s success in Indonesia, given that there
        are different cultures within Indonesia such as Sumatra and Java. “Stay
        curious, stay vigilant in learning and always try to understand others,”
        said Johnny.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        <strong>Q&amp;A</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before concluding, the panel speakers welcomed the audience&rsquo;s
        questions, which was related to the youth demographics in Indonesia.
        Effendy shared that the youth market is exceptionally important in the
        online services such as air travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as compared to the entire consumer market, youths do not make a
        significant difference yet since Indonesia is a highly conservative
        country. With the influence of social media, youths in Indonesia tend to
        look more for brands which they can better relate to instead of branded
        names.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABYA would like to thank the panel for the personal and professional
        sharing on the factors that have guided their careers in Indonesia, as
        they see a future in ASEAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these insights, ABYA will continue to establish connections between
        ASEAN and Singaporean youths, whilst constantly seeding information
        influence to nurture ASEAN-savvy youths.
