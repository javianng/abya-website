        On 17 April 2021, ASEAN Business Youth Association (ABYA) and
        Yale-NUS&rsquo; Southeast East Asian Society (SEAS) had hosted an
        esteemed panel of speakers at *SCAPE HubQuarters to share their
        experiences and insights on pursuing a career in a cross-cultural
        environment (Safe distancing measures were observed). The session
        featured the speakers, <strong>Mr Brian Liu</strong> (Senior
        Vice-President, People, Lazada Group), <strong>Ms Joelle Pang</strong>{" "}
        (General Manager, FastJobs Malaysia), and{" "}
        <strong>Mr Rahul Daswani</strong> (Head of People and Culture of Open
        Government Products, GovTech Singapore) with{" "}
        <strong>Mr Edmund Twohill</strong> (Vice-President (Regional Product
        Delivery), DBS Bank) moderating the panel.

        This event was proudly supported by *SCAPE, a non-profit organization
        that supports youth, talent and leadership development, as well as
        Singapore Global Network, an organization that seeks to build meaningful
        and lasting relationships with family and friends across the globe, with
        Singapore at the centre.

        The past year has, if nothing else, redefined how we work and where we
        can work. In the throes of the great remote working revolution, such
        arrangements might be here to stay. With the acceleration of remote
        working due to the global pandemic, however, it is also ironic that the
        closing of international flight borders may open up a larger market for
        borderless careers. The requirement for physical proximity is no longer
        a factor to some.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this mean for the future of work in Southeast Asia? How can
        youths prepare for and thrive in cross-cultural borderless teams? The
        panel engaged the audience in a candid sharing of personal experiences,
        whilst examining the opportunities and challenges with expanding
        one&rsquo;s career in an increasingly cross-cultural environment.

        At present, Edmund works with several teams in India in his portfolio,
        with the Regional Product Delivery team in DBS. From his experience, he
        realized the importance of understanding the different working
        arrangements of a multinational team. One key realization from managing
        a team operating in different countries, is that meetings should always
        be planned with the time zone difference in mind. Additionally, it is
        important to be mindful of the various holidays that countries have,
        which makes planning ahead important, for deadlines to be met.

        Joelle had shared that when she had made the transition from her
        corporate job to a start-up, it was her involvement in the ASEAN markets
        was the most exciting period for her. She now manages FastJobs&rsquo;s
        operations in Malaysia, as the local General Manager. With the different
        cultural norms that she has experienced, she realized that these
        real-life encounters go beyond what someone would know about in work and
        interpersonal matters, without experiencing it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, Rahul had shared his experiences from the time that he was
        working in Jakarta, Indonesia, as a consultant with McKinsey &amp;
        Company. During his time there, he realized the importance of resisting
        the temptation of staying in one&rsquo;s &lsquo;social bubble&rsquo;
        with his fellow other expatriates. He encourages youths to likewise make
        the effort to engage the locals there, such as through learning their
        language, Bahasa Indonesia, to truly connect with and understand the
        cultures there.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        Pursuing Opportunities in Different Forms
      </h2>
      <p>
        As Edmund looked back on his career, he felt that working in another
        country was an option that he regretted not exploring. Despite now
        understanding the cross-cultural knowledge that such an experience would
        have provided, age and the “liabilities” that have come with it has made
        it a difficult endeavour to pursue in the later years of one&rsquo;s
        career. Rahul echoed this point, emphasizing the importance of constant
        self-reflection on one&rsquo;s values &ndash; so that one may pursue the
        opportunities that most aligns with his or her vision without regret.
        For him, such a mindset took him from unconventional roles in developing
        countries like Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia at a stage when he
        prioritized the maximization of impact, to later returning home to the
        public sector, given the shift in focus &ndash; to his family. Given
        this, it was a clear decision for him to shift back home, Singapore, to
        join the public sector &ndash; where he could still deliver impact and
        make time for his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Brian, it has always been clear to him that his interest lies in
        navigating cross-cultural environments. Thus, even if he were offered a
        high position and well-paying Singapore-only role versus a regional
        role, he would still choose the latter. Brian has recommended a book
        called “The Culture Map” by Erin Meyer, which he uses for foundational
        coaching and training, and managing cross-cultural teams.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Leading By Example</h2>
      <p>
        On the topic of gaining trust in a multicultural team, Rahul shared the
        importance for individuals to set their own boundaries. For instance,
        teams can have the discussion on how they would best work with each
        other. Having such reviews with managers on expectations, such as their
        tolerance for flexibility, is something very important for Rahul. With
        such autonomy, demonstrating competency in meeting these expectations
        set, would also build up trust. In essence, “the more you can manage
        yourself, the less your boss has to manage you”.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Joelle, trust within her team can be understood and developed
        through the framework of &lsquo;Why, What and How&rsquo;. As the leader
        in her team, it is her responsibility to align her team with the vision
        of the company (the WHY), as well as defining the business goals,
        expectations and the values (the WHAT) within the team. Additionally,
        she also employs an open-door policy for feedback, such that it would be
        a collective effort in discussing how the team can get there together
        (the HOW). Moreover, trustworthy relationships are also built through an
        understanding of one&rsquo;s team members on a more personal level. This
        was especially the case in countries such as the Philippines, where she
        had found it to be a cultural norm that colleagues will have 4-hour
        dinners to bond together over food.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Building Trust as a Fundamental Concept</h2>
      <p>
        Reiterating that trust is the basis for relationships, Brian had noted
        that trust also manifests differently in different places. In countries
        such as Canada and Australia, task-based trust is more prevalent, while
        countries in Asia lean more towards relationship-based trust. For
        relationship-based trust, one needs to spend more time to get to know
        people and exchanging personal stories. By setting the tone and openness
        in sharing with one&rsquo;s team, he or she would thus be able to
        encourage reciprocation of such openness from others. For further
        learning, Brian has recommended another book, “Speed of Trust”, by
        Stephen M. R. Covey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way of building trust is in strengthening one&rsquo;s tacit
        knowledge and practising of cultural values and behaviours. When
        presented the opportunity to either join Lazada or Facebook, Brian had
        instead pursued his interest in working with a culture unfamiliar to
        him. This was given that his choice to join Lazada would make it the
        first Chinese company he would be working with. Through this experience,
        he is thus able to advise that in Chinese cultures, &lsquo;face&rsquo;
        is important. In such scenarios, one should not overtly challenge others
        during public meetings, but speak in private to share about your
        different views.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Closing Remarks</h2>
      <p>
        To end the session, the participants were welcomed to enter breakout
        sessions with the panellists, to engage in a more intimate dialogue on
        personal curiosities and career aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, ABYA is humbled to hear both from the speakers and youths, on
        the perceived and actual challenges, along with the differing
        aspirations in pursuing career development with a cross-cultural
        element.
      </p>
      <p>
        This session had been ABYA&rsquo;s first physical event since the start
        of the global pandemic, with safety measures regulating against physical
        gatherings for over a year. ABYA is thus very appreciative for all the
        support received thus far, from its partner organizations and youth
        participants.
