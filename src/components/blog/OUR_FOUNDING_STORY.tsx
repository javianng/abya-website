        Among youths in Singapore, majority do place an emphasis on career
        preparation, however have reflected that they are less likely to
        prioritise overseas exposure, with even less focus on the Association of
        Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. This was understood from ASEAN
        Business Youth Association&rsquo;s survey findings, alongside data
        provided from Young NTUC&rsquo;s census on close to 1300 youths. Yet,
        this lack of prioritsation in ASEAN-readiness appears to be a concern,
        especially given that the future of Singapore&rsquo;s economy will be
        largely interdependent with the region. ASEAN is predicted to be the
        fourth largest economy by 2030, whilst being home to the world&rsquo;s
        third largest labour force in the world today.

          Founding ABYA
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since October 2019, a team of youths have been working hard to
        understand the Singaporean youths&rsquo; mindsets towards ASEAN. A
        recurring theme was that language barriers and differences in lifestyles
        within these developing economies make youths hesitant towards pursuing
        opportunities within ASEAN. The team also sought to find out whether
        ASEAN was less favourably perceived compared to the Western countries,
        and if so &ndash; what information sources Singaporean youths were
        turning to. Whether these were first-hand experiences, or impressions
        left from media interpretations, also appeared to be a key influence in
        how youths perceived the ASEAN countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the team also dug deep to uncover the existing ASEAN
        opportunities that youths typically turn to â€” if they did have a
        pre-existing interested in ASEAN. Through this, the team defined
        actionable targets and founded &lsquo;ASEAN Business Youth
        Association&rsquo; (ABYA). Its mission is to nurture ASEAN-savvy youths
        by establishing a competency-building platform to provide Singaporean
        youths developmental opportunities in networking, cultivating ASEAN
        awareness, and cross-cultural activities in Singapore and the ASEAN
        region.

        , the Youth Action Challenge is a programme under the larger Youth
        Action Plan that seeks to engage youths in change maker projects, within
        the three pillars of issues related to the economy, society, and
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is through the continuous support from the Youth Action Challenge
        that the team had found a common platform to discuss issues related to
        ASEAN. These youths had realized that there was a common issue
        experienced within their generation of youths, and they thus proceeded
        with founding ABYA.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABYA&rsquo;s idea to cultivate ASEAN-readiness amongst Singaporean
        youths was furthermore picked up by the local current affairs and
        culture digital magazine,{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-whining-singaporean-youths-tackling-problems-today/"

        , that featured ABYA&rsquo;s president, Veronica Low and her motivations
        for pursuing this initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Youth Action Challenge has also provided the youths behind ABYA
        ample opportunity to develop their ideas, through ideation tools,
        mentorship, prototyping, and pitching sessions, and a generous seed
        funding of $5000 to kickstart ABYA&rsquo;s plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABYA has been fortunate to be under the close guidance of its mentors,
        Malminderjit Singh, Editor at Channel News Asia, Wendy Tan, Head
        (Covering Director) at the National Trade Union Congress, and Andrew
        Pang, Chief Consultant at Mycelium Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2020, ABYA had reached another milestone, in becoming
        officially inducted as one of Young NTUC&rsquo;s affinity groups. Young
        NTUC is Singapore&rsquo;s largest youth movement and youth wing of the
        National Trade Union Congress (NTUC). ABYA realizes great synergy with
        Young NTUC ,to further Singapore&rsquo;s youth developmental
        opportunities within ASEAN. Young NTUC will continue to support ABYA
        through mentorship, access to network and operational support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, ABYA is still on its eight month journey, as it gears up for its
        upcoming pitch in June 2020. ABYA will pit its idea, for an &lsquo;ASEAN
        Business Youth Association&rsquo;, against eleven other teams at the
        Youth Action Challenge Summit. If emerged as one of the top four teams,
        ABYA will receive a maximum of $50,000 to accelerate its ongoing plans
        to nurture Singapore&rsquo;s youths and leaders of tomorrow, with
        ASEAN-readiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABYA has also received the privilege of being showcased on
        Mediacorp&rsquo;s MeWatch, as part of the Youth Action Challenge Summit,
        such that teams can have a wider opportunity in garnering support from
        the public audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking into the future, ABYA anticipates challenges as it continues to
        negotiate between the public and private sector for youth developmental
        opportunities with regard to ASEAN. This gives ABYA an opportunity in
        being a representative voice for Singaporean youths who have a keen
        interest in becoming prepared to work with or in the ASEAN countries.
