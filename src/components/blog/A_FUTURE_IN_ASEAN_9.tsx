        On 13th March 2021, ASEAN Business Youth Association (ABYA) co-hosted a
        webinar with National Youth Council (NYC) on the topic of
        &lsquo;Navigating the India-ASEAN Economic Landscape&rsquo; as part of
        ABYA&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Future in ASEAN&rsquo; monthly dialogue and
        NYC&rsquo;s Asia- Ready Exposure Programme (AEP) webinar series. They
        had the privilege to invite panelists from across ASEAN and India
        comprising of. Edward Yee, Co-founder of Givfunds Social Ventures, and
        Pung Wan Qing, Senior Assistant Director in the Emerging Markets
        Division at the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. The webinar
        was moderated by Archana Atmakuri, Research Analyst at the Institute of
        South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore. The panel
        speakers shared insights about the economic landscape and opportunities
        between ASEAN and India.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Personal Experience</h2>
      <p>
        During the panellists&rsquo; sharing of their insights, Edward shared
        his experience when he visited India for the first time and observed
        economic ecosystem differences in some major cities in India, such as
        New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Besides Edward, Wan Qing also noted
        differences of economic ecosystems in the Middle East, Africa, and South
        Asia. Both Edward and Wan Qing noticed that India has the potential to
        become one of the world&rsquo;s economic powerhouses, as many consulting
        firms like McKinsey are also noticing India&rsquo;s fast-paced economic
        growth with its population of 1 billion people.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Promising Growth in India and ASEAN</h2>
      <p>
        There has been growth in numerous sectors between India and ASEAN. For
        example, there has been growth in consumer goods trade between India and
        Singapore since 2004, rapid growth in foreign direct investment (FDI)
        between the two countries since 2010, and increasing interactions in
        financial services, trading, and industries between the two countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singapore&rsquo;s reputation as one of world&rsquo;s trading hubs and
        Asia-Pacific&rsquo;s destination for multinational companies, and
        India&rsquo;s investment potential amidst increasing operational costs
        in China, demonstrates the promising growth in economic relations
        between India and ASEAN.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rapid increase in technology penetration and development of IT
        talents, has also become one of the key drivers for India&rsquo;s
        economy, as well as consumption by India&rsquo;s population.
        India&rsquo;s government sees opportunity to create more manufacturing
        jobs for Indian citizens, with potential investments in electronics and
        textiles diversifying from China to India.

        Economic and Social Challenges and Efforts to Overcome Them
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although India has much potential, there are problems faced by India in
        reducing poverty, ensuring gender and social equality and in providing
        safety in certain regions. Negative sentiments about India have also
        been expressed by certain netizens through internet and online media.
        However, these are issues also present in many developing countries, and
        both speakers and the moderator agreed that Indians are generally very
        hospitable towards foreigners. India has also been making some progress
        in tackling public safety and inequality issues, despite the
        international media&rsquo;s tendency to overfocus on high profile
        criminal acts in India over the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome economic challenges, India has attempted to boost economic
        ties with other regions such as ASEAN by ratifying regulatory agreements
        such as the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between
        Singapore and India and strengthened investment cooperation between
        ASEAN and India. The speakers also encouraged participants to visit
        India in the future to have a more comprehensive view on Indian society
        and explore potential opportunities in areas such as investment and
        trade.
      </p>

        On a final note, the panellists noted important points and conclusions
        regarding topics discussed in the webinar. They expressed hope that both
        ASEAN and India&rsquo;s economy will continue to grow after the COVID-19
        pandemic ends to benefit people in the regions. We would like to thank
        the speakers for your insights and to our members for participating in
        this webinar. Finally, we also express our heartfelt gratitude to our
        co-organizers NYC, along with our supporting partners Singapore Global
        Network, Young NTUC and OSG Youth Alliance for their continued support
        for ABYA.
