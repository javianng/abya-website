          In an increasingly competitive and globalized job market, possessing
          core skills and competencies is vital to securing careers that fit our
          aspirations. However, many fresh graduates fall short in meeting the
          expectations of recruiters: 47% of employers deem the lack of
          technical skills and knowledge as the greatest impediment in hiring
          for entry-level positions, whereas the dearth of overseas experience
          is cited as one of the greatest obstacles in recruiting Singaporean
          professionals. (AmCham, 2020) As economic integration intensifies
          within ASEAN, job-seekers are faced with new opportunities and
          challenges: enhanced mobility of talent and services provide suppliers
          with more openings in the region, whereas unfettered HR regulations
          may raise the bar for applicants in a larger talent pool.

          How can youths better equip themselves with competitive skill sets to
          succeed in tomorrow's job market?

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Personal Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        For both Sheriel and Anupama, it is evident that their careers required
        adapting to different circumstances amidst a variety of different
        industries. For instance, Anu started her career in investment banking
        for thirteen years before beginning her second career in executive
        search in Singapore. Meanwhile, Sheriel started her career as a
        consultant at Deloitte before working at Get All Myanmar Co.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recounting their travel experiences, Sheriel talked about the
        differences between visiting as a tourist, a consultant (providing
        professional services) and working in a company based in Myanmar
        full-time. While adapting to different roles, Sheriel had to constantly
        reflect on how to root herself in a new country and how to better
        understand the culture. This rigorous questioning allowed her to better
        understand what the local community perceives as valuable and how to
        tailor the company&rsquo;s services towards addressing this demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anupama first came to Singapore as a trailing spouse, thus having to
        start her career from scratch, with investment banking. As much as it
        was physically and mentally taxing, Anupama reflected how it was
        rewarding to learn to adapt to the Singaporean context, transitioning
        from the environment in India. Ultimately, she particularly likes how
        Singapore is a melting pot of cultures, embracing the principles of
        multiculturalism and diversity.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">1. Reflection and Developing Oneself</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond technical skills and academics, Sheriel and Anu stressed the
        importance of developing oneself. The importance of one&rsquo;s
        individuality, developing one&rsquo;s unique value proposition was
        underscored. &lsquo;
        <em>
          What skills do you wish to develop to attain the goals you&rsquo;ve
          set for yourself? What is distinct about you?
        </em>
        &rsquo; are questions one would need to reflect on, in this journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a recruiter&rsquo;s point-of-view, students who are able to show
        confidence and bring a diversity of experience to the table will be able
        to value-add to the company. Rather than ticking off a checklist or a
        stipulated formula, youths need to gain an array of different
        experiences culturally. Beyond technical skills, recruiters constantly
        question how a new hire could viably value-add and fit into the company
        culture! Ultimately, HR recruiters can discern whether you are being
        true to yourself, whether you are able to acknowledge what you do not
        know; authenticity goes a long way!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, it is only through rigorous self-reflection that one can discern
        one&rsquo;s priorities and come off as genuine.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        2. Building a Sustainable Career Progression
      </h2>
      <p>
        Secondly, in terms of career progression, one must be willing to learn
        and adapt to different job-scopes and situations, planning your CV such
        that it shows resilience to an array of circumstances. Even if youths
        don&rsquo;t have overseas experiences, they must show that they can
        adapt to new environments. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example,
        Sheriel advises youths to be able to adapt to unprecedented
        circumstances, showing interviewers that they are able to do so. For
        Sheriel, she gained a source of fulfilment from social entrepreneurship
        and community service, and thus does this in a local context via grocery
        delivering to the underprivileged even though she is unable to travel at
        the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Anu advises new graduates not to “job hop” overly frequently.
        Rather, graduates should look towards sustainable development and
        building credibility within one organization, get used to a single
        organization, that you have the ability to take on different roles and
        capacities. Doing so will allow you to show that you are committed to a
        cause and are adaptable to a variety of positions, increasing your
        marketability to future employers.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">3. Risk-taking and Discomfort</h2>
      <p>
        Thirdly, youths must be used to discomfort in building resilience,
        expanding your comfort zone while not going beyond your comfort zone to
        the point of mental health risks. Succeed and failures are transient.
        Anu advises graduates not to “let it get to your head” when you succeed,
        instead reflecting on why you succeeded. To add on, Sheriel states that
        there are many rewards you miss out when you don&rsquo;t take risks in
        your career. As such, graduates should be eager to try new experiences,
        investing in stretching yourself through taking a part-time internship
        while juggling studies. Ultimately, as we enter the Fourth Industrial
        Revolution, being able to absorb new experiences and leverage on
        Singapore&rsquo;s multiculturalism is particularly crucial, along with
        keeping your learning muscle active to absorb new skill sets constantly
        even after attaining a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, students should not expect full certainty in attaining
        a job, get rid of the mentality that “doing A would attain B”. After
        all, companies are not looking at Singaporeans, but the entire world!
        ASEAN is a highly dynamic region, with Indonesia&rsquo;s growing
        unicorns and Myanmar&rsquo;s recent digitalization, leapfrogging into
        the 4IR. Increasingly, youths must look beyond being an individual
        contributor via specialization to a broad-based leader-cum-generalist.
        To end off, Sheriel and Anu both highlighted the importance of aligning
        your goals and actions, thinking deeply into what you want - being
        constantly unsatisfied simply leads to a quarter-life crisis, where one
        is unable to be satisfied with one&rsquo;s current circumstances.
