        ABYA is proud to introduce its series of dialogue sessions, entitled
        &lsquo;A Future in ASEAN&rsquo; (AFIA), which will feature prominent
        speakers who will share their ASEAN related experiences and insights
        with the ABYA community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the intensifying COVID-19 pandemic, ABYA has taken its dialogue
        session to a video conference through Zoom, which saw over 30 eager
        participants on the evening of 30th April 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the session, ABYA hosted Nghi Luc Tran, Lucas, a Marketing Lead
        Development Representative at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the
        multinational cloud computing company. His prior experiences in project
        management and marketing at ePlus Event Company, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam,
        also give him insights into the differences, between Vietnam and
        Singapore ⁠— in terms of work and lifestyle. Lucas holds a double
        masters in Management and International Business, from Kedge Business
        School and University of Vaasa, while he currently also pursues his
        interests in being a lifestyle vlogger who shares his perspectives as a
        Vietnamese national working in Singapore.

      <h2 className="blogheading1">Vietnam Vs Singapore</h2>
      <p>
        One key topic from the session is how Lucas contrasts the culture and
        working styles between Vietnam and Singapore. This is with regard to his
        experiences from having worked in a family business and a multinational
        enterprise, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, Lucas mentioned that his experiences with hiring processes in
        Vietnam reflected a greater focus on one&rsquo;s existing professional
        experience, unlike that in Singapore which places greater emphasis on
        the individual&rsquo;s career development and potential. This may also
        be due to the limited resource and manpower available in his prior
        company. However, the effects of such were that employees resultantly
        stuck to tasks closely within their scope, whilst having little room for
        progression for long periods of time. In his later career with AWS in
        Singapore, he has realised greater enthusiasm and proactiveness, given
        that he is empowered to work on projects within teams, while the company
        does rotate its employees every so often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, it appears that the work culture in Vietnam is more
        hierarchical, with heavy expectations for employees to prioritise their
        company&rsquo;s needs through their tasks. This is converse to
        Singapore&rsquo;s work culture, in which employees are thus more
        encouraged to offer constructive ideas to their company. Thirdly and
        most interestingly, employees in Vietnam tend to be equally close with
        each other, in both their work and personal lives, where the contexts
        are sometimes blurred. Singapore, on the other hand, has immersed him in
        a work culture driven by clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to
        drive greater efficiency and functionality.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">
        Laying the Foundation for One&rsquo;s Career
      </h2>
      <p>
        Lucas emphasised greatly on the need to find a mentor who would be
        willing to train and guide his or her career development. He had
        mentioned that one should be on the lookout for opportunities, even upon
        entering one&rsquo;s first job, and that it would be crucial to grab
        hold of them to develop one&rsquo;s fullest potential. Emphasising
        personal awareness, Lucas had also noted that it is essential for one to
        acknowledge one&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, before one would be
        able to put his or her best foot forward ⁠— especially in venturing into
        a new area of work, or even country. Apart from developing one&rsquo;s
        skills, Lucas also stressed on the importance of being flexible. An
        example of this would include being willing to join organisations, such
        as ABYA, which would immerse one in a community with a strong people
        network and common interests that build on each other. He advises anyone
        keen to improve, to “join, connect and make new friends”, and be ready
        to “learn not to expect” because one should be ready to adapt and “go
        with the flow”.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Outlook on Marketing and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Lucas envisions that ASEAN will turn into a technology hub in five
        years&rsquo; time. With more potential in its market value, large
        companies will turn their eyes to ASEAN, looking to invest and create
        more job opportunities in the region. Given his professional experience
        as a marketing specialist and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, he
        shared his advice on how to get an edge in preparing for jobs in the
        technology industry. His observation is that mobile applications now
        often use Cloud Computing, through a Software as a Service (SaaS)
        delivery model. He notes that individuals keen on entering
        customer-facing roles would benefit from learning more about Salesforce
        and SAP, as these softwares are increasingly adopted by large companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, he foresees that technical aptitude would be essential for
        non-technical users, as many companies are progressively entering a
        digital transformation process. He thus advocates for many to receive
        technical certifications, such as the Cloud Practitioner certification
        ⁠— which can be attained online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Lucas gave a comprehensive overview of the marketing
        industry, with reference to small-medium businesses, enterprises and
        start-up businesses. Marketing broadly involves in-bound marketing and
        outsource marketing agencies. In-bound marketing teams require strategic
        and planning skills while outsource marketing agencies require greater
        execution capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, Lucas&rsquo; advice is to find relevant certifications such
        as Google&rsquo;s Inbound Certification, Google AdWords and Facebook
        Blueprint Certification. Google and Facebook do offer free online
        courses for people looking to get a head start.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
      <p>
        Before concluding, Lucas welcomed the audience&rsquo;s questions,
        largely related to his perspectives as a Vietnamese national within
        ASEAN. Lucas had recalled that he had initially not considered venturing
        abroad, given the language barrier. It was revealed that the lack of
        ability to speak the English language inhibits many from his home
        country, from being willing to venture further into the region.
        Moreover, Singapore is often looked to as the pinnacle of opportunity
        within ASEAN. In contrast, he jokingly cautioned the audience that they
        may have to adjust to a culture shock, as foreigners visiting Vietnam.
        This is given country&rsquo;s comparatively less convenient and speedy
        transportation systems. Nonetheless, he is upbeat about young aspirants
        who wish to venture into Vietnam, to which he mentioned that Vietnam is
        very welcoming towards its foreign guests, such that being a foreigner
        would be an added advantage.
      </p>
      <h2 className="blogheading1">Concluding Remarks</h2>
      <p>
        ABYA would like to thank its audience and youth community for its active
        participation during its first session of AFIA, &lsquo;A Future in
        ASEAN&rsquo;. It was surely an eventful learning opportunity with Lucas!
        ABYA looks forward to creating more positive memories, as captured in
        this Zoom conference.
