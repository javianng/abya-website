        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Starting off the session, our speakers introduced their respective
        enterprises to our participants. Somsak introduced attendees to Local
        Alike, which has been running for the past 10 years and has worked with
        more than 160 communities and over 40,000 travellers in Thailand with
        the vision of uplifting communities through sustainable tourism. Apart
        from tourism, Local Alike also caters to the needs of urban consumers
        through 2 other brands, Local Aroi and Local Alot. Local Aroi seeks to
        satisfy the taste buds of urbanites through the provision of regional
        cuisine prepared by villagers through catering services, private dinner
        sessions and set menus delivered to customers. Local Alot aims to be the
        largest online marketplace selling local products in Thailand by 2022 by
        partnering with villagers to provide the knowledge of marketing and
        selling online. Since its inception just over 45 days ago, Local Alot
        has garnered 15,000 supporters and customers and generated 2.6 million
        baht in revenue for communities participating in the marketplace.

        Following Somsak, Minh Ngoc introduced participants to Green Lady
        Vietnam, which aims to provide education and eco-friendly products for
        women&rsquo;s health issues which would allow women to feel more
        empowered in taking charge of their lives. Green Lady Vietnam&rsquo;s
        customers are mainly urban women aged 28 to 35 who are working and are
        active on social media. They are conscious about the environmental and
        chemical effects brought about by using disposable hygiene products and
        turn instead to Green Lady&rsquo;s range of eco-friendly products, which
        include locally made organic cloth pads, natural washing soap and
        cleansing hydrosols. Apart from hygiene products, Green Lady Vietnam
        also produces herbal packs and teas for female consumers and had
        conducted extensive educational programmes through the use of workshops,
        exhibitions and online blogs to teach women who are either young or part
        of disadvantaged groups on female health issues such as menstruation.

        Finally, Russ introduced participants to Social Collider, an aggregator
        company he founded that aims to provide resources for social
        entrepreneurs and connect impact organizations (social enterprises) with
        other groups that are interested in collaborating with them. Social
        Collider is built on the 4 “Es” of Empower, Educate, Enrich and
        Ecosystem and seeks to fulfil its mission through programmes such as
        social entrepreneurship workshops, hackathons and overseas service
        learning. It has 4 theme based working spaces at with its HQ at Ubi,
        Sustainability Hub at Republic Plaza, Elderly Innovation Hub at Lorong
        Ah Soo and Inclusive Hiring space at Tanjong Pagar. It also has an
        academy where workshops are conducted and it has partnered with various
        organisations such as the Chi Heng Foundation, National University of
        Singapore and the United Nations Development Programme on various
        initiatives.

        <strong>Fireside Chat</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The speakers were then invited to discuss pertinent issues in social
        entrepreneurship through a fireside chat moderated by Qianyi. They were
        asked on how they were inspired to start their journeys in social
        entrepreneurship. Somsak grew up in a poor rural environment in Thailand
        and strived towards achieving higher education to get his family out
        from poverty. After doing his MBA in sustainable management in the
        United States, he realised the potential for development in the tourism
        industry in Thailand given the 40 million tourists it typically receives
        in a year. However, the mass tourism prevalent in Thailand often left
        rural villagers with little earnings due to its nature, while
        sustainable tourism which could further benefit these villagers was
        sorely lacking at the time. Somsak thus decided to set up Local Alike to
        help uplift these rural communities while gaining market advantage as
        one of the few sustainable tour operators in Thailand.

        Minh Ngoc was inspired to venture into female body care and hygiene
        products through Green Lady Vietnam after attending the eco-village
        design education course in 2016. She collaborated with some Cambodian
        friends on creating eco-friendly cloth pads as a project before
        realising that her vision of providing education on female health and
        eco-friendly healthcare products for women could only be sustained by
        scaling up her project to become a social enterprise, which she managed
        to accomplish in less than 2 years despite facing numerous challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russ was formerly an educator with the Ministry of Education in
        Singapore before proceeding to Tsinghua University for his MBA. He had a
        mindset change towards social entrepreneurship while doing his MBA
        thesis and was struck by the potential of the industry to uplift the
        lives of millions living in poverty after hearing about the efforts of a
        former Hong Kong banker who set up a foundation to assist families
        inflicted with HIV in China. Many of these families comprised of
        villagers who were compelled to sell their blood to pharmaceutical
        companies as a means to improve their financial situation, but who
        suffered from the lasting effects of the HIV virus as medical equipment
        was not properly sterilized when the extraction of blood took place.
        This set him towards a path in social entrepreneurship to eventually
        become the founder of Social Collider and Partner for Impact Initiatives
        at Quest Ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The speakers were also questioned regarding starting a social enterprise
        in other ASEAN countries such as Thailand and Vietnam and the challenges
        they faced in their entrepreneurship journey. Both Somsak and Minh Ngoc
        concurred that finding a local business partner or like-minded local
        NGOs to assist in the setting up of business operations is important
        given that social enterprises are not given preferential treatment under
        Thai and Vietnamese laws and have to be at least 51% locally owned like
        any other business. Russ felt that a key challenge that social
        enterprises could face while operating in regional countries is the lack
        of infrastructure to accommodate new technologies, especially as there
        are still many rural parts of ASEAN that do not enjoy readily available
        internet access. Minh Ngoc added on sharing that the challenges brought
        by COVID-19 have forced many social enterprises like Green Lady Vietnam
        to expand their presence on the internet and this was a challenge at the
        beginning as she had seen the enterprise as a traditional business that
        made most of its sales through physical outlets. However, Somsak also
        noted that despite the increasing need for technology, maintaining a
        human connection with customers is still important for businesses in the
        hospitality industry like Local Alike. Finally, both Russ and Minh Ngoc
        acknowledged that despite the impression that some might have of social
        enterprises as a business which does not emphasise on profits, ensuring
        the survival of the enterprise while fulfilling the purpose and mission
        it seeks to achieve is important which necessitates a balance between
        the two elements.

        <strong>Advice for Youths</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Somsak advised youths to follow their passion when setting up a social
        enterprise as it takes time to scale and adapt the business to
        challenges and opportunities in the world of social entrepreneurship.
        Minh Ngoc emphasised that youths considering a journey into social
        entrepreneurship need to be comfortable and confident with what they set
        out to achieve as venturing into social entrepreneurship is not a
        conventional career path that is taken by a majority of youths. Russ
        further added to Somsak&rsquo;s advice by asking youths to find their
        purpose when setting up a social enterprise. He noted that purpose is
        mostly inspired by individual experiences and having a sense of purpose
        is something that has helped him resolve many problems he has faced
        along the way. Among the questions youths could ask themselves are: 1.
        Who they want to help, 2. What issues do their target beneficiaries face
        and 3. What is their solution to these issues. Before the session
        concluded, he urged budding youth entrepreneurs to think about how their
        enterprises could help disadvantaged communities through giving them the
        skills they need to uplift themselves as doing so would give them the
        sense of purpose and inspiration throughout their journey in social
        entrepreneurship.
