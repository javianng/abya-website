        In the heart of Jakarta, at the vibrant DWNTWN bar, the ASEAN Business
        Youth Association (ABYA) hosted an electrifying Dinner & Dialogue on
        Thursday 31st August 2023. With the theme of "Harnessing Innovation and
        Technology for Sustainable Business Growth in ASEAN," the evening was an
        exploration of the crucial role that innovation and technology play in
        shaping the future of Southeast Asian business. Led by Joel Shen, a
        partner at Withers and an ABYA advisor, along with Abyasa Kamdani, Head
        of Business Development at Sintesa Group, the panel discussion was a
        dynamic exchange of ideas and insights.

        Unlocking the USP of Projects and the Benefits of Innovation
      </h2>
      <p>
        Abyasa Kamdani opened the conversation by delving into the concept of
        Unique Selling Proposition (USP). He emphasized how understanding and
        effectively leveraging the USP of projects can be a game-changer for
        businesses. "The financial benefits are undeniable," he stated,
        underlining the economic incentives of innovation. Kamdani also
        highlighted the importance of networking, emphasizing that great
        connections sustain great businesses.

        Addressing Air Pollution and Raising Awareness on ESG
      </h2>
      <p>
        Joel Shen, a legal expert with a passion for environmental concerns,
        brought air pollution into the spotlight. "When everyone makes small
        changes together, it may happen small but there is still a change," Shen
        said. He believed that the younger generation has the knowledge and the
        willingness to drive significant change in the near future. The
        discussion then turned towards Environmental, Social, and corporate
        Governance (ESG) considerations. Abyasa Kamdani stressed the importance
        of shaping those who can make an impact and sharing reports
        transparently. "Sustainability is about value," he emphasized. "Being an
        example to others is paramount. If you are really creating value, people
        will see that." Kamdani urged attendees not to shy away from sharing
        their sustainability efforts, as it can inspire great things.

        Innovative Approaches for Environmental Protection
      </h2>
      <p>
        Protecting the environment was another vital topic. The panel stressed
        the importance of creating awareness about environmental issues and
        clearly outlining strategies for addressing them. "Character is very
        important, and when you have a strong passion for something - people can
        see it," Kamdani stated. Collaboration was seen as a powerful tool to
        tackle shared problems, with the focus on changing someone's world
        rather than changing the world as a whole.

        As the night drew to a close, the energy in the room was buzzing with
        newfound connections and shared experiences. Laughter echoed through the
        venue as the group gathered for a big group panoramic photo, a testament
        to the unity and camaraderie that was present in the evening. It was
        clear that this networking event wasn't just about business; it was
        about forging lasting bonds and creating memories. With hearts full of
        optimism and pockets filled with business cards, everyone left with a
        sense of satisfaction, knowing that they had been a part of something
        truly special.

      <p>
        I had the pleasure of working with ABYA as a guest speaker on several
        events including topics surrounding family companies and sustainability-
        it’s safe to say my experience was very enjoyable and I would recommend
        it to all parties. I see their genuine passion in trying to share
        knowledge with today’s younger generation as well as providing further
        value by connecting others through expanding networks and opportunities.
        I appreciate how organized they were able to accomplish the necessary
        tasks and always take in new ideas on how we can further develop the
        event together. My team and I were able to work with them closely and
        efficiently towards the same vision for the experience of the audience.
        Thank you ABYA for providing the opportunity as well as all the work
        you’ve done in the community. On behalf of the Sintesa Group, we look
        forward to engaging with you again. — Abyasa Kamdani, Head of Business
        Development at Sintesa Group
