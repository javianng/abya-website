        In 2022, ABYA conducted 2 events and worked with close to 10 speakers
        and moderators in the process. In partnership with National Youth
        Council Asia-Ready Programme (NYC AEP), ABYA introduced the trends and
        opportunities of ASEAN's future economy in its first webinar session
        with over 110 participants.

        Subsequently, ABYA explored more about technology and digitalisation in
        ASEAN, gaining close to 30 participants for the session. This webinar
        session opened conversations between the speakers and participants about
        the latest industry trends and happenings in ASEAN, and also segued into
        ABYA LEAPS focusing on the same theme.
